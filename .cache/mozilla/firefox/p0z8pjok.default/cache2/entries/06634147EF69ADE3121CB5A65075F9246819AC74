Every year at this event, hundreds of companies and universities gather to show what they've been doing in the past year in supercomputing and HPC.</p>\n<p>As usual, the highlight of this event for me is the student cluster competition. Teams from around the world gather to compete on which team can make the fastest, most efficient supercomputer within certain constraints. In particular, the machine must be built from commercially available components and not consume more than a certain amount of electrical power while doing so.</p>\n<p>This year's teams come from Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia, and come from a pool of applicants of hundreds of universities who have been narrowed down to this list.</p>\n<p>Of the 15 teams participating, 11 of them are running their clusters on CentOS. There are 2 running Ubuntu, one Running Debian, and one running fedora. This is, of course, typical at these competitions, with Centos leading as the preferred supercomputing operating system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.centos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181114_094226.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1550\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://blog.centos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181114_094226-300x128.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p>The teams are given a variety of projects to work on before they get here, and then there is one surprise project that is presented to them when they arrive.

I recently had to implement a new template for a custom service, that is multi-instances aware, and so can be started multiple times with various configurations, and so with its own set of settings, like tcp port on which to listen, etc .. , but also the number of instances running as it can be different from one node to the next one.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about the best way to implement this through Zabbix, and my initial idea was to just have one template per possible instance type, that would though use <a href=\"https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.2/manual/config/macros\">macros</a> defined at the host level, to know which port to check, etc .. so in fact backporting into zabbix what configuration management (Ansible in our case) already has to know to deploy such app instance.</p>\n<p>But parallel to that, I always liked the fact that Zabbix itself has some internal tools to auto-discover items and so triggers for those : That's called <a href=\"https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/discovery/low_level_discovery\">Low-level Discovery</a> (LLD in short). </p>\n<p>By default, if you use (or have modified) some zabbix templates, you can see those in actions for the mounted filesystems or even the present network interfaces in your linux OS. That's the \"magic\" : you added a new mount point or a new interface ? Zabbix discovers it automatically and start monitoring it, and also graph values for those.</p>\n<p>So back to our monitoring problem and the need for multiple templates : what if we could use LLD too and so have Zabbix automatically checking our deployed instances (multiple ones) automatically ? The good is that we can : one can create <a href=\"https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/discovery/low_level_discovery#creating_custom_lld_rules\">custom LLD rules</a> and so it would work OOTB when only one template would be added for those nodes.</p>\n<p>If you read the link above for custom LLD rule, you'll see some examples about a script being called at the agent level, from the zabbix server, at periodic interval, to \"discover\" those custom discovery checks.\nThe interesting part to notice is that it's a json that is returned to zabbix server , pointing to a new key, that is declared at the template level.</p>\n<p>So it (usually) goes like this : </p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a template</li>\n<li>create a new discovery rule, give it a name and a key (and also eventually add Filters)</li>\n<li>deploy a new <a href=\"https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/config/items/userparameters\">UserParameter</a> at the agent level reporting to that key the json string it needs to declare to zabbix server</li>\n<li>Zabbix server receives/parses that json and based on the checks/variables declared in that json, it will create , based on those returned macros, some Item Prototypes, Trigger prototypes and so on ...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Magic! ... except that in my specific case, for some reasons I never allowed the zabbix user to really launch commands, due to limited rights and also the Selinux context in which it's running (for interested people, it's running in the <a href=\"https://arrfab.net/posts/2016/Nov/25/zabbix-selinux-and-centos-731611/\">zabbix_agent_t</a> context)</p>\n<p>I suddenly didn't want to change that base rule for our deployments, but the good news is that you don't have to use UserParameter for LLD ! . It's true that if you look at the existing Discovery Rules for \"Network interface discovery\", you'll see the key net.if.discovery, that is used for everything after, but the Type is \"Zabbix agent\". We can use something else in that list, like we already do for a \"normal\" check</p>\n<p>I'm already (ab)using the <a href=\"https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/trapper\">Trapper item type</a> for a lot of hardware checks : reason is simple : as zabbix user is limited (and I don't want to grant more rights for it), I have some scripts checking for hardware raid controllers (if any), etc, and reporting back to zabbix through zabbix_sender.</p>\n<p>Let's use the same logic for the json string to be returned to Zabbix server for LLD. (as yes, Trapper is in the list for the discovery rule Type.</p>\n<p>It's even easier for us, as we'll control that through <a href=\"http://www.ansible.com\">Ansible</a> : It's what is already used to deploy/configure our <a href=\"https://repospanner.org\">RepoSpanner</a> instances so we have all the logic there.</p>\n<p>Let's first start by creating the new template for repospanner, and create a discovery rule (detecting each instances and settings) :</p>\n<p><img alt=\"zabbix-discovery-type.png\" src=\"https://arrfab.net/images/zabbix-discovery-type.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can then apply that template to host[s] and wait ... but first we need to report back from agent to server which instances are deployed/running. So let's see how to implement that through ansible.</p>\n<p>To keep it short, in Ansible we have the following (default values, not the correct ones) variables (from roles/repospanner/default.yml):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre>...\nrepospanner_instances:\n  - name: default\n    admin_cli: False\n    admin_ca_cert:\n    admin_cert:\n    admin_key:\n    rpc_port: 8443\n    rpc_allow_from:\n      - 127.0.0.1\n    http_port: 8444\n    http_allow_from:\n      - 127.0.0.1\n    tls_ca_cert: ca.crt\n    tls_cert: nodea.regiona.crt\n    tls_key: nodea.regiona.key\n    my_cn: localhost.localdomain\n    master_node : nodea.regiona.domain.com # to know how to join a cluster for other nodes\n    init_node: True # To be declared only on the first node\n...\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>That simple example has only one instance, but you can easily see how to have multiple ones, etc\nSo here is the logic : let's have ansible, when configuring the node, create the file that will be used zabbix_sender (triggered by ansible itself) to send the json to zabbix server. zabbix_sender can use a file that is separated (man page) like this :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hostname (or '-' to use name configured in zabbix_agentd.conf) </li>\n<li>key </li>\n<li>value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those three fields <em>have</em> to be separated by one space only, and important : you can't have extra empty line (but something can you easily see when playing with this the first time)</p>\n<p>How does our file (roles/repospanner/templates/zabbix-repospanner-lld.j2) look like ? : </p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"x\">- repospanner.lld.instances { &quot;data&quot;: [ </span><span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"nv\">instance</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"nv\">repospanner_instances</span> -<span class=\"cp\">%}</span><span class=\"x\"> { &quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"s1\">'{#INSTANCE}'</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">&quot;: &quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">instance.name</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">&quot;, &quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"s1\">'{#RPCPORT}'</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">&quot;: &quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">instance.rpc_port</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">&quot;, &quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"s1\">'{#HTTPPORT}'</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">&quot;: &quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">instance.http_port</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">&quot; } </span><span class=\"cp\">{%</span>- <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"k\">not</span> <span class=\"nb\">loop</span><span class=\"nv\">.last</span> -<span class=\"cp\">%}</span><span class=\"x\">,</span><span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">endif</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span><span class=\"x\"> </span><span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">endfor</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span><span class=\"x\"> ] }</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>If you have already used jinja2 templates for Ansible, it's quite easy to understand. But I have to admit that I had troubles with the {#INSTANCE} one : that one isn't an ansible variable, but rather a fixed name for the macro that we'll send to zabbix (and so reused as macro everywhere). But ansible, when trying to translate the jinja2 template, was complaining about missing \"comment' : Indeed {# ... #} is a <a href=\"http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#comments\">comment in jinja2</a>. So the best way (thanks to people in #ansible for that trick) is to include it in {{ }} brackets but then escape it so that it would be rendered as {#INSTANCE} (nice to know if you have to do that too ....)</p>\n<p>The rest is trival : excerpt from monitoring.yml (included in that repospanner role) : </p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"x\">- name: Distributing zabbix repospanner check file</span>\n<span class=\"x\">  template:</span>\n<span class=\"x\">    src: &quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">item</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">.j2&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"x\">    dest: &quot;/usr/lib/zabbix/</span><span class=\"cp\">{{</span> <span class=\"nv\">item</span> <span class=\"cp\">}}</span><span class=\"x\">&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"x\">    mode: 0755</span>\n<span class=\"x\">  with_items:</span>\n<span class=\"x\">    - zabbix-repospanner-check</span>\n<span class=\"x\">    - zabbix-repospanner-lld</span>\n<span class=\"x\">  register: zabbix_templates   </span>\n<span class=\"x\">  tags:</span>\n<span class=\"x\">    - templates</span>\n\n<span class=\"x\">- name: Launching LLD to announce to zabbix</span>\n<span class=\"x\">  shell: /bin/zabbix_sender -c /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf -i /usr/lib/zabbix/zabbix-repospanner-lld</span>\n<span class=\"x\">  when: zabbix_templates is changed</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>And this is how is rendered on one of my test node : </p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre>- repospanner.lld.instances { &quot;data&quot;: [ { &quot;{#INSTANCE}&quot;: &quot;namespace_rpms&quot;, &quot;{#RPCPORT}&quot;: &quot;8443&quot;, &quot;{#HTTPPORT}&quot;: &quot;8444&quot; }, { &quot;{#INSTANCE}&quot;: &quot;namespace_centos&quot;, &quot;{#RPCPORT}&quot;: &quot;8445&quot;, &quot;{#HTTPPORT}&quot;: &quot;8446&quot; }  ] }\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>As ansible auto-announces/push that back to zabbix, zabbix server can automatically start creating (through LLD, based on the item prototypes) some checks and triggers/graphs and so start monitoring each newly instance.\nYou want to add a third one ? (we have two in our case) : ansible pushes the config, would modify the .j2 template and would notify zabbix server. etc, etc ...</p>\n<p>The rest is just \"normal\" operation for zabbix : you can create items/trigger prototypes and just use those special Macros coming from LLD : </p>\n<p><img alt=\"zabbix-item-prototypes.png\" src=\"https://arrfab.net/images/zabbix-item-prototypes.png\"
